# Discord Game Status

## Why?

It is annoying that you can't just set your own status in discord

## How?

- Download and run this program
- It works best in Windows 10 if you pin it to start menu

#### Then follow these steps in discord:

You still have to change the name in discord.

Click the settings icon next to your name

Click Game Activity

![click Game Activity, then click Add It](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micahlagrange/discord-game-status/master/help-2.png)

Under the game activity bar, which will show "No game detected" unless you have a game open, click "Add it!"

Choose this program from the dropdown. If you have never changed it before, it will show something like `C:\Users\{user}\path\to\downloaded\location\discord-game-activity.exe`

Now you just rename it in discord to match whatever game you want to play.

For example "Monster Of The Week" is an RPG I play and it has always annoyed me that I can't set my discord status accordingly.

Now your status should be set. ( You may need to flip on the switch labeled `Display currently running game as a status message.` )

Also, now the right game shows next to your name in channels, dms, etc...

Discord will remember this for the next time you launch this program.

If you ever want to change it, just rename it in the settings menu the same way!
