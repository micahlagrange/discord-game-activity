# Discord Game Status

## Why?

It is annoying that you can't just set your own status in discord

## How?

### Run it

- Download and run this program from [here](https://github.com/micahlagrange/discord-game-activity/wiki)
- It works best in Windows 10 if you pin it to start menu

### Update the name

You still have to change the name in discord.

Click the settings icon next to your name

![click the gear icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micahlagrange/discord-game-activity/master/help-1.png)

Click Game Activity

![click Game Activity, then click Add It](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micahlagrange/discord-game-activity/master/help-2.png)

Under the game activity bar, which will show "No game detected" unless you have a game open, click "Add it!"

### Make it pretty

Choose this program from the dropdown. If you have never changed it before, it will show something like `C:\Users\{user}\path\to\downloaded\location\discord-game-activity.exe`

Now you just rename it in discord to match whatever game you want to play.

For example "Monster Of The Week" is an RPG I play and it has always annoyed me that I can't set my discord status accordingly.

Now your status should be set. ( You may need to flip on the switch labeled `Display currently running game as a status message.` )

Also, now the right game shows next to your name in channels, dms, etc...

Discord will remember this for the next time you launch this program.

### Update it

If you ever want to change it, just rename it in the settings menu the same way!
